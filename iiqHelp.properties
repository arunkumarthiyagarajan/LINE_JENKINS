#Role Mining
help_mining_max_training=Maximum number of identities to analyze.  It is not always necessary to analyze every identity to determine a useful set of roles.  Setting this may improve mining performance.  If not specified, all identities within the search filter will be analyzed.

#Workflow Config Forms help text
help_wf_provisioning_approval_setting=Select which of the approval settings you would like to be enabled for Provisioning requests. The allowed values are 'Owner', which is where the owner of the requested object(s) is required to approve. The 'Manager' setting is where the user's manager will be required to approve and 'SecurityOfficer' which is where the identity named in the variable securityOfficerName will be required to approve. In some cases for IdentityIQ changes there may be a manager change, so there is also an option named "New Manager" where the newly assigned manager will get approval. Which options are available will depend on the workflow being edited.
help_wf_provisioning_approval_disable=Select this option to disable all approvals
help_wf_provisioning_policy_scheme=Select a value that specifies how policy checks effect the overall workflow process. The allowed values are 'Disable Policy Checking' to skip checking policies,  'Continue on Policy Violation(s)' will continue even if policy violations are found, 'Present Failures to Requestor' to allow requester to remove items which are causing violations (this option is only available on certain workflows), or 'Fail Workflow' which will cause the workflow to terminate immediately if any policy violations are found.
help_wf_provisioning_policy_check=Select "All" to check all policies or select "Selected" to select which policies you want to check during provisioning. 
help_wf_provisioning_notification_scheme=Select a value that specifies who should be notified when the request has been complete. The allowed values are 'Notify User' which indicates the Identity that is being updated will be notified, 'Notify Manager' which will notify the Identity's manager, and 'Notify Requester' which will notify the person that has requested the changes.
help_wf_provisioning_notification_disable=Select this option to disable all notifications
help_wf_provisioning_identities_scheme=Select one or more Identities or Workgroups that should approve requests.
help_wf_provisioning_user_template=Select the email template to use for user notification.

Normally provisioning is done in a step that uses the "background" option to force the workflow to be suspended and be resumed in a background task thread.  This prevents the browser session from hanging since provisioning can sometimes take a long time.  For demos and testing it can be better to do this in the foreground so that provisioning will have been performed when control is returned to the user.  This prevents having to run the Perform Maintenance task to see the results of the request.
help_wf_provisioning_optimistic=Select this if you want changes to the entitlements compiled from role assignments to be applied immediately to the identity cube rather than waiting for the next refresh/reaggregation after the provisioning system completes the request.
help_wf_provisioning_refresh=Select this checkbox to cause an identity refresh after the changes in the plan have been provisioned.  This is normally unchecked, you might want this on if you want modification of identity or link attributes to result in an immediate re-evaluation of assigned and detected roles.

help_wf_provisioning_reference_update=This argument is currently set by the workflow using a run time reference.  References and scripts can make the behavior dynamic based on the workflow context. If you want to add specific literal values for this step argument click the checkbox and enter the desired value(s).
help_wf_provisioning_approval_reminder_frequency_days=Enter how frequently (in days) the approver should be sent a reminder email.
help_wf_provisioning_approval_mode=Select which mode should be used when approvals are created.  When parallel is selected all approvers will get the approvals at the same time, where serial requires each approver to make decisions in order until all of the approvals have been completed.
